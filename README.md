# Computer Organization & Design Labs Repository

This repository showcases the culmination of efforts undertaken during the Computer Organization & Design lecture at University of Thessaly.
The labs presented here delve into the core aspects of modern computer systems and their intricate design.

## Labs Overview

The repository encompasses a series of labs meticulously crafted to facilitate a comprehensive grasp of computer organization and design.
Through hands-on exploration and analysis, these labs offer insight into the intricate relationship between hardware and software components within computing systems.

The initial three labs serve as a foundation, aiming to acquaint the intricacies of assembly language.
The following labs progressively guide participants through the construction of a MIPS processor, starting with a single-cycle architecture.
Subsequently, the labs extend the design to a multi-cycle paradigm featuring five pipeline stages, introducing additional instructions for a comprehensive learning experience.

To accomplish these objectives, the labs will employ the Verilog hardware description language alongside a curated library of essential components.
This comprehensive library encompasses crucial units vital for the implementation of the processor's data segment, including Memory, Register File, and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
